            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is matter of great Grief and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, to ſee any of our People, much more ſo many, lying ſhort (for want of Light) of this great Chriſtian Duty of <hi>Singing Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs;</hi> which, as the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are enjoyned in the New Teſtament to do, ſo we find it was always practiſed by the Lords People generally in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, in Gods Worſhip, both in Time of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel:</hi> But more eſpecially to find ſome amongſt us ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in Oppoſing of it, and others to make Diviſions upon the Practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet find ſo little Argument againſt it. Mr. <hi>Steed</hi> (as it ſeems to us) hath not ſo fairly ſtated the Queſtion as he ſhould, which ought to have been this: Viz. <hi>Whether Singing the Praiſes of God by the whole Church
<pb facs="tcp:179241:3"/>in their publick Aſſemblies, be a Goſpel Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or not?</hi> However, we have read and conſidered this enſuing <hi>Anſwer</hi> to his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and finding it ſo fully and ſoberly done, think it neceſſary to recommend it to all your Conſiderations, hoping it may tend to enlighten many of your Souls who as yet have doubts about it, which that it may, we ſhall commit it to the Bleſſing of the great God, and remain</p>

            <p>THat common Proverb uſed amongſt us, <hi>viz. That Cuſtom is a ſecond Nature,</hi> we find true in things Natural and Religious: Old Cuſtoms, tho never ſo bad, are hardly left, <hi>Jer. 13.23.</hi> and long neglected Duties we come up ſlowly to. And that which makes Reformation in any thing the more difficult, is that Oppoſition it uſually meets with, many times, from thoſe, whoſe Duty and Office doth in a ſpecial manner Oblige them to reſtore every Trdth of God that's fallen in our Streets. And ſuch hath been our caſe, (tho much to be lamented) that when it pleaſed God to open the Eyes of many amongſt us into that holy Ordinance of Singing his Praiſe both in Private and Publick, and from the clear Evidence of his Word, made us ſenſible that this part of Divine Worſhip, ſo frequently commanded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Holy Writt, both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is as Ancient as the World, and will continue when Time ſhall be ſwallowed up in Eternity. We had then no Mind to have publiſhed our thoughts to the World, nor to have troubled the Churches with any Diſſertations about it. But endeavoured to have a Friendly Debate with our Brethren, who were conven'd to conſult the Churches Welfare: But our Endeavours theretn being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Oppoſers of this Truth; Soon after ſome of them, from an imprudent Zeal to maintain their own miſtaken Sentiments, openly oppoſed this holy Truth of God, and took unto themſelves a kind of lawleſs Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only to calumniate thoſe who endeavoured the reſtoration of this Ordinance, but alſo to Reproach the
<pb facs="tcp:179241:4"/>Truth of God in this particular, by calling it <hi>Will-Worſhip, Formal, Carnal, Invented,</hi> &amp;c. which put us upon a neceſſity (unleſs we would betray the Truth of Chriſt by a ſinful ſilence) to diſcover their great Miſtakes and unaccountable Abſurdities and Prevarications herein, to all that deſire to wait upon God in the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to remove the Stumbling-blocks that buſie men have endeavoured to trouble thoſe Churches with, who deſire to live in peace. This hath occaſioned the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this little Treatiſe now in thine hand, which is hereby recommended to thy diligent and candid peruſal; and whoever thou mayest be that readeſt, I have onely theſe few things to deſire of thee: Make the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> thy Rule in Judging, lay by all Prejudice, weigh what thou findeſt in the Ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and do not judge before thou haſt read what is ſaid for this holy Ordinance. And remember, that every Truth of God, hath ſome Adverſaries, and if thou wilt not receive Truth, untill its Adverſaries have nothing to ſay, thou muſt receive no Truth at all, untill the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is bound, and all the Nations of the World unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Wait at the Throne of Grace, in a humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for Light in this particular; if thou art yet in the Dark concerning this holy Inſtitution. And whether thou doſt own and practiſe this Ordinance or not, ſee that thou put on Charity towards thoſe that are otherwiſe minded; and if you cannot all agree, to ſing the Praiſes of God together here on Earth, I am ſure all the Children of God will harmonize in this Work in Heaven. Now that the Lord might bleſs this little Treatiſe to thy Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Truth of Singing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> to his own Glory, and thy Souls and others Comfort and Edification, is the Deſire, and ſhall be the Prayer of thine in the Lord,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAD you wrote private Letters to your own people about your ſentiments concerning ſinging the praiſes of God, to obſtruct the reſtoration of that bleſſed Goſpel Ordinance, and not have publiſhed it to the World, we might have ſeen no ſuch Cauſe (as now we do) to anſwer your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
            <p>When we heard you were a writing, we expected it would have contained an anſwer to what hath lately been publiſhed in vindication thereof by Reverend Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> Mr. <hi>Keach,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whinnel,</hi> &amp;c. but we now ſee no ſuch thing attempted, but contrarywiſe only a heap of words, being little elfe than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> hath troubled the World and Churches with. And it ſeems as if the Sermon you formerly preached againſt this Holy Truth of Chriſt, was the muddy Fountain from whence his lines proceeded; and that it was you thoſe worthy Perſons in the dark contended with, which was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome of us ſome time ſince.</p>
            <p>But truly Sir, this way of yours ſeems new as well as ſtrange: Hath any controverſible Truth met with ſuch uſage? you at once give up the cauſe provided thoſe weighty Treatiſes, ſo full of Scripture Arguments are not anſwer'd; for all men may ſee all that you have ſaid, fully anſwered before your Epiſtle was printed: But you, 'tis like, foreſaw ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179241:5"/>great Advantage by your Eſſay, in that you find ſome of your People ſo hardened, and prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Singing the Praiſes of God, that they will not be at the charge to buy thoſe Books, nor trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to read them, and you giving yours away, we ſee we muſt do the like, if we would leave them without excuſe here, and in the great Day.</p>
            <p>There is one thing that we cannot paſs by without Lamentation, <hi>viz.</hi> in that you were not ſatisfied to preach down in your Congregation what your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother Mr. <hi>Know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> your Fellow Elder, who is (as we may ſay) the Father of the Church, had preached up, but now writ-againſt him alſo; One would have thought Modeſty, and Reſpect to his great Age, Learning, and Sincerity, and to prevent reproach, might have ſtopped your Pen, and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed attempt: Is it not ſad to ſee that one Elder in ſuch a Cauſe and Spirit, ſhoald appear in print againſt another? Are theſe things lovely, or of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? could you have found no other way to have put an end to the controverſie amongſt your own People, ſince you pretend only to be concerned for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your own Congregation? There are ſome who alſo have too much conntenanced Diviſions in Churches upon the account of Singing the praiſes of God, we ſhall be glad if you can clear your ſelf in that matter: And the more inexcuſeable they ſeem to be, ſince to their Knowledge the Aſſembly of the Elders, Miniſters and Meſſengers of our Churches declared their utter diſlike of any Breach or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Churches upon the account of the practice or non-practice of Singing of Pſalms, as 'tis now, and and hath in every Age been performed; and alſo gave Advice to the contrary: Moreover, your Epiſtle is diſperſed abroad, and many of them given away in divers Churches in the City, and amongſt others in the Countrey.</p>

            <p>But to proceed, thô your Epiſtle hath nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it but what hath been effectually anſwered, yet we think it not convenient to let any thing come out, deſigned to obſtruct or hinder the practice of this great and Sacred Duty without an Anſwer; we ſhall therefore examine each part and paragraph thereof, and give you a Sober Reply, that ſo all ſtumbling-blocks may be removed out of the way of Gods People, and thoſe Churches cleared from the charge of humane Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are in the practice of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, For your great care for the Souls of your People no Body can blame you: But in <hi>Page</hi> 1. to ſuggeſt that Satan may beguile them by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to this Ordinance of Singing Pſalms in God's publick Worſhip, ſhews you are of a bitter Spirit, and very cenſorious. It was not Satan but Jeſus Chriſt, in your Reverend Brother, who ſtrove to promote that Truth of his in his own, and other Churches of the Saints; had you mentioned any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing you call an Error, which your Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in danger to be beguiled with: This ſhould have been paſs'd by. But to put us out of doubt what your meaning is, you in <hi>page</hi> 3. ſeem to bewail thoſe dear Churches Satan hath hereby beguiled already.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place we will come to conſider of the great Queſtion which you ſay is raiſed among the Baptized Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> We are glad the proper queſtion is raiſed among the Baptized Churches, and the practice of it too in near thirty of them, divers others alſo having to the praiſe of God, and Joy of our Souls, lately receiv'd it, and have got, and are endeavouring to get into the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof. Nor will the hard Names you give it hinder the general reception of it, unleſs you had any hard Arguments to bring againſt it, which we ſee you have not found as yet, and we are ſure never will, for 'tis in vain to ſtrive againſt the ſtream of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Truth of ſinging the praiſes of God too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Common way of Singing,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis a good word if well intended: We read of <hi>common Salvation, common Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Our way of Preaching is never the worſe becauſe 'tis the common way that other Churches have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and is uſed by other Miniſters, nor no more is our way of Singing. 2. It may be called <hi>common</hi> becauſe uſed before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, in the Churches of Chriſt in the pureſt Times. 3. Let it alſo go for the common way of Singing, as that which is owned and vvitneſſed to by Gods Word, and his faithful People in oppoſition to ſome unknovvn, unheard of and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vvay vvhich you ſuggeſt, vvhich no body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands: for ſinging of Pſalms, <q>You ſay, is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it may be, nay, ſhould be practiſed in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Church, <bibl>

               </q> But hovv it ought to be done, no Body can underſtand by your Epiſtle, the way you hint at is hidden; ſome mode or manner it is you would have, but 'tis a ſecret not yet revealed; 'tis a hard caſe you ſhould ſuggeſt, that a Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, enjoyned on the Churches, ſhould lie ſo dark and obſcure in Chriſts New Teſtament, that no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be able to underſtand what the matter is which ſhould be ſung, nor who the Perſons are that ſhould ſing, and yet the Holy Ghoſt calls them Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, <hi>[a ſet ſtinted Form.]</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> A ſet ſtinted Form, we affirm poſitively in the fear of God, is laid down both in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. A Pſalm cannot be a Pſalm, nor a Hymn an Hymn, nor a Spiritual Song a Song, without a ſet ſtinted Form, it can't be without ſo many diſtinct ſet or ſtinted words, Syllables and Lines.</p>
            <p>You may as well ſay a Chapter is not a ſet ſtinted Form, as once to ſuggeſt the Scripture-Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, which the Holy Ghoſt enjoyns the Churches to ſing, are not ſet and ſtinted Forms; or to ſuppoſe becauſe ſet and ſtinted Forms, they are to be exploded as an invention of men: Pray Brother how came Scripture, Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, which in the Original are in Metre, to be the Inventions of carnal men? Had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men a hand in compiling the Sacred Bible, and enjoyning Goſpel Precepts? and how came a ſet ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Form of Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contained, and plainly laid down in Gods Word, to be as bad or worſe than a ſet and ſtinted Form of humane compoſed and impoſed Prayers; when humane inventions are as good as Divine and Sacred Inſtitutions, we will be of your mind, and then we will ſay you ſpoke Truth, but not till then can we believe you, nor regard what you ſay on this account. If there had been no Scripture, Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in being, nor known to the Churches, when the Holy Ghoſt enjoyned them to ſing Pſalms: Or if the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit might not ſerve and enable us as well to put a Pſalm or Hymn in order to be ſung, as a Doctrine in order to be preached: Then you might ſay the Church was to wait for ſome extraordinary effuſion of the Spirit, or ſome miraculous Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, before they could perform that Duty; nor could that Duty be performed longer than ſuch gifts abode in the Church: And if ſo, you had ſaid ſomething, but now we ſee you have ſaid nothing that has weight in it: but more of this anon. You ſay, <hi>With a whole Congregation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179241:7"/>every one together without exception, lifting up their Voices together,</hi> [that is in ſinging.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Muſt this way of Singing be exploded as an invention of men, God forbid, for then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the whole Congregation were guilty of an invention of men, and <hi>Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak, David,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and which is worſe, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi> nay, and an invention of men is enjoyned on the Church; for they all are enjoyned thus to be Sung together, every one of them, not one excepted, take two or three Arguments further to make it appear, the Churches were thus required to ſing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That way Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung, the Churches were to ſing, becauſe Christ and his Diſciples ſet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Pattern: But Christ and his Diſciples ſung all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is fully proved in the late Treatiſes.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Churches are enjoyned to ſing, and not one Member is exempted or excepted, then they are all to ſing, and to ſing together according to the Pattern given by Chriſt and his Diſciples; but the Churches are enjoyned to ſing, and not one Member exempted or excepted:</hi> Ergo, <hi>They all are to ſing, and to ſing together according to the Pattern given by Chriſt and his Diſciples,</hi> Mat. 26:30 Mark 14.26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If ſinging Gods Praiſes were under the Law with Voices lift up together, and the Saints are in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament required to ſing, and no other way is preſcribed or laid down how they ſhould ſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Saints in the New Teſtament ought to ſing as they ſang under the old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch was the Singing of Gods People under the Law, and the Churches are enjoyned to ſing Pſalms in the New Teſtament, and no other way preſcribed or laid down how they ſhould ſing,</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Churches are now to ſing in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as Gods People under the Lqw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you ſay the former, that is, <hi>Singing with Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179241:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>together, was unanimouſly concluded by the moſt part, if not all the Baptized Churches, to be Will-worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reply.</hi> Suppoſe it was ſo concluded to be by them then, might they not be miſtaken? Had they attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a perfection of Knowledge in the whole Will of God? or were thoſe Churches appointed by the Lord to be our Pattern further than they followed Chriſt and the Primitive Church?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ask you whether or no generally the ſame Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Churches in thoſe times did not as unanimouſly conclude and declare it too, that for a Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to have a Yearly Allowance, or a competent Maintenance, was an humane Invention and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? We ſpeak in part upon our own Knowledge, and by good Information we have had from others, that both thoſe Goſpel Duties and Ordinances were equally decryed, and we ſuppoſe you are not Ignorant of it; nay, and we hear ſome Churches, or members of thoſe Churches are of the ſame Opinion ſtill. How now Dear Brother, are you for building what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; if not, we are no more guilty in the one than you are in the other, and to our grief, ſince it was ſo concluded then, we find it comes to be ſo hard a thing to bring our Churches to embrace the one or the other as they ought.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What if through a hot, and an unaccountable Zeal, our Churches in the beginning of the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation did throw away ſome pure Gold with much Antichriſtian droſs, ought they not, now God hath graciouſly been pleaſed to open their Eyes, to labour to recover the Gold again, we mean both thoſe great Goſpel Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> Singing of Scripture Pſalms, and the Miniſters maintenance. Honoured Brother, <hi>The path of the Juſt is as a ſhining light, that ſhines more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. God doth not diſcover all his whole Mind and Will to his people at once, but ſome at one time, and ſome at another.</p>
            <p>And bleſſed be God, there are ſome riſen up, of whom Mr. <hi>Steed</hi> is one, who affirms, That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179241:8"/>of the Goſpel ought to have a competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſo that they may comfortably live of it, and ſome others are riſen up, who do not only affirm that, but alſo that the Churches ought to ſing the praiſes of God, and prove it too by undeniable Arguments, and in that common way that was uſed by the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law, and by the Lord Jeſus, and his Church and Churches under the Times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>And as it is now commonly uſed in moſt Churches of Chriſt in our days, <hi>viz.</hi> with Voices lifted up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and hereby we do build what was wanting, and reſtore an Ordinance too long neglected by ſome of the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Others contemn our way of preaching, and call it a common Artificial acquired attainment, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and call our Singing: But how dare you ſo raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, or intimate, That this way of Singing is brought into ſome Churches by the guile and policy of Satan, and compare it with Common Prayer? have you an infallible Spirit? Men may in ſome caſes be bold in their aſſertions, when they ſpeak of ſome Truths that the whole Body of the Godly are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in: But thus to ſpeak againſt an Ordinance, which almoſt all the Faithful people of God, and Churches now and in every Age, have received as an undoubted Truth of Chriſt, is hard.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering how weak your Arguments ſeem to be, or how little you have to ſay againſt it Sir, this way of ſinging of Scripture Pſalms, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Ordinance of Chriſt, as Preaching, Prayer <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſuch, and ſo it will appear one day, ſay you what you pleaſe, who affirm ſinging to be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church, and yet ſing not properly at all in any manner of way, but wholly live in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this great Duty.</p>
            <p>But you in <hi>Page</hi> 2. affirm, you are for ſinging: Theſe are your words, <hi>viz. The outcry is, you are againſt ſinging in the Church, if Perſons in Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179241:8"/>testifie againſt common ſinging, as that which ought not to be uſed in a Church of Chriſt, which, ſay you, is falſe, and as vile a Slander as the former, for they are for ſinging, that is, for praiſing of God, or teaching one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or themſelves in Pſalms and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Brother, 'tis a hard caſe prejudice againſt an Ordinance ſhould ſo blind your Eyes, that with all your Learning, you ſhould not know what ſinging is, but conclude ſimple praiſing of God in Prayer, is ſinging: hath not Mr. <hi>Keach</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Treatiſe clearly confuted this Conceit, to which you make no reply: Singing is a diſtinct act of the Voice, and 'tis known to all mankind how it differs from any other acts of the bodily Organs, as Mr. <hi>Goſnal</hi> once told Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi> in a diſcourſe they had about it.</p>
            <p>We ſay and teſtifie you ſing not, and do appeal to all men in the World, whether praiſing God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſinging; thô you do praiſe God, yet we ſay you do not ſing his Praiſe, which the Churches are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to do. Are you willing to joyn iſſue in this one ſingle point in a ſober Diſpute? If you can prove you ſing in any proper ſenſe, (for 'tis not an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or metaphorical ſinging which the Holy Ghoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns on the Churches) we will give up the Cauſe to you. But if that be not ſinging you ſpeak of, you muſt acknowledge 'tis true, what you are charged with, <hi>viz.</hi> That you are againſt ſinging in the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd ſo wholly neglect it, through ignorance of what at is: And it cannot be a falſe Calumny or Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you are charged with, which you intimate <hi>Page.</hi> 2. whilſt you decry that way of ſinging which you call <hi>common,</hi> ſith you are in the practice of no ſinging at all, neither of the whole Church, nor of one ſingle perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can any wiſe man be ſo ignorant as to conclude thoſe Precepts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. do mean a bare <hi>exhorting one another</hi> out of the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and not ſuch an admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, that is in <hi>ſinging</hi> of them?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179241:9"/>That we are exhorted to ſing Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no man who has not loſt his ſenſes can deny; and if that ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was no more than <hi>praiſing</hi> God in Prayer, then it would follow, in Prayer we <hi>exhort</hi> one another, and <hi>ſpeak</hi> one to another; and how abſurd it is to affirm, that, we will leave to all mens conſideration.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, we have a great reſpect for you, and doubt not but God hath endowed you with good abilities to preach his Word; but this Expoſition of yours, of <hi>admoniſhing one another in Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſinging and making melody in our hearts to the Lord,</hi> muſt be wholly exploded as a great Error.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To proceed, if Goſpel ſinging were nothing elſe than praiſing of God in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why do you ſpeak of <hi>waiting</hi> for ſuch Gifts from the Holy Spirit, as may put you into a Capacity to perform it fully according to the primitive Platform and Pattern? Theſe words betray you, and may ſufficiently inform every mans judgment who ſhall read your Epiſtle, that you are conſcious to your ſelf of the preſent want of the practice of this great Goſpel Duty which you ſay <hi>may,</hi> nay <hi>ſhould</hi> be in a Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For if you ſing when you praiſe God, and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Mind of God in thoſe Goſpel Precepts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. what need you wait for ſuch gifts to put you into a capacity to perform it fully, according to the Primitive Platform and Pattern? it appears that ſolemn giving of thanks or praiſing of God in Prayer, is not ſinging according to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Platform in your Conſcience and Confeſſion: (certainly, to do duty, and not according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Pattern, is ſinfull;) but that the primitive way or manner of ſinging you are waiting for; in which it ſeems you are turned Seeker: we dread the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of your Notion, and that it may inſnare many gracious and well-meaning Chriſtians. May not they well ſay, Since we have not thoſe ſpecial Gifts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one Ordinance, and that we ought not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it untill we have ſuch Gifts which were in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179241:9"/>Primitive Church, we muſt peform or practiſe none untill thoſe extraordinary Gifts do return, (which there is no ground to believe ever will:) This is what the <hi>Seekers</hi> aſſert, and was we of your mind in the caſe of Singing, we know we could not withſtand the caſting off all Ordinances, from ſuch a Suppoſition you ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
            <p>How inconſiſtent to Goſpel ſimplicity doth what you affirm ſeem to be, let all men judge: One while you are for Singing, and intimate you are in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it too; and what ſinging is that? Why, you tell us, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis <hi>praiſing of God,</hi> and if that be not Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then you are wholly without it.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this Singing, you intimate you are waiting for ſuch Gifts as may put you into a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to perform it fully according to the primitive Platform and Pattern: So that it ſeems you do not ſing as yet according to the primitive Platform and Pattern, and if ſo, your ſinging cannot be allowed, nor will it ſerve to diſcharge that Goſpel Duty; becauſe every thing in Gods Worſhip that is accepted, ought to be done according to the primitive Pattern; but if the one be Goſpel Singing, there's no need of the other, and if the latter which you wait for Gifts to perform at preſent, be the true primitive way of Singing, certainly the other can be no ſinging at all: Becauſe it differs quite in the Nature of it from that which you intimate you are waiting for Gifts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>You call the <hi>common way</hi> an <hi>Invention,</hi> and render it as bad as offering ſtrange Fire, but you do not prove 'tis ſo. You mention Reverend Mr. <hi>Edward Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> who you ſay was concerned; that ſuch ſort of Singing was to be avoided as Will-worſhip: 'Tis ſtrange if he lookt upon it with ſuch an evil Eye, he did not leave a Teſtimony againſt it, as he did againſt <hi>Laying on of Hands</hi> upon Baptized Believers as ſuch.</p>
            <p>But what do you mention Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> for, as one on your ſide? May not we cite Reverend Mr. <hi>Tomes,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:179241:10"/>a man famous beyond moſt for the Baptized Way, who was for this Way of Singing; and ſo was the Learned and pious Mr. <hi>Goſnall,</hi> and the late pious, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, laborious, learned and faithful Mr. <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly <hi>Vavaſor Powel,</hi> and ſo is the Reverend, Pious Learned and Laborious Mr. <hi>Hanſ. Knowls,</hi> and ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of able Divines perhaps not inferiour to any of them. Compariſons are not pleaſing, but why may not one faithfull, pious and learned Miniſter be regarded, and his Steps and Sentiments followed, as well as another? All the Baptiſts were not againſt this way of Singing when firſt our Churches were planted.</p>
            <p>But let ſome worthy men ſay what they pleaſe, and call it Will-worſhip, we matter it not, ſince we find this way of Singing was alwayes uſed both under the Old and New Teſtament: Tho Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> and his Congregation would not ſing together, yet Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons</hi> great Maſter Jeſus Chriſt and his Congregation, did ſing together, who is our Pattern, and not Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Harriſon,</hi> further than he followed Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But why will you not enter into the Liſt of this Controverſie? pray be not unwilling to anſwer thoſe Books lately publiſhed, or elſe diſpute out this point ſoberly, in a ſweet cool Goſpel Spirit? If you can convince us we are in an Error, we ſhall retract it, and bleſs God for your care of our Souls, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which you affirm are carried away with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of men, from our Virgin ſimplicity: we ſhall now examine what you lay down in the fourth page of your Epiſtle, which it ſeems is the heads of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you preached againſt Singing, after Reverend Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> had in the Morning preached it up as a Goſpel Ordinnace: ſad caſe!</p>
            <p>Firſt, <q>You ſay you ſhall ſhew what Singing is, that may or ſhould be practis'd in a Goſpel Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <q>In what order or manner it ought to be managed according to Divine Appointment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <q>How it appears that the Common Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:179241:10"/>
            <p>Fourthly, <q>Shall conſider you ſay, ſome Scriptures that are alledged for this common Singing in the New Teſtament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <q>Shall mention ſomething concerning your waiting on the Lord for the full reviving of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the primitive Pattern.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, (you ſay,) <q>As to what that Singing is that may or ſhould be practiſed in a Goſpel Church, I ſhall thus briefly, ſay you, deſcribe it, <hi>viz.</hi> It is the ſolemn, joyful diſtinct expreſſing or ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the high praiſe of the great God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth ability or utterance to an Elder, or gifted Brother, in a Church or Aſſembly of the Saints, which is to be brought forth from a right frame, and to be managed in an orderly manner, according to the direction given us in the Holy Scripture of the New Teſtament, which is the only Rule for the diſcovery of, and guiding us into the practice of Goſpel Ordinances, whereunto it doth not appear, nor can it be proved that the common Artificial Rhimes, Meaſures or Tunes are eſſential to it, I ſay they are not Eſſential to it, though not unlawful.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Reply.</hi> We muſt needs ſay your method is well cut out, but ill made up.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, you leave us in the dark about what you believe ſinging is, thô you ſay it is a diſtinct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing or ſounding forth the high praiſe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for you may yet mean as far as any Body can ſee, hereby only praiſing of God in Prayer, unleſs you had added, 'tis a ſolemn diſtinct expreſſing or ſounding forth the high Praiſes of God, by a <hi>muſical melodious modulation or tuning of the Voice,</hi> which only diſtinguiſhes what ſinging is, from any other diſtinct act of the bodily Organs, as 'tis always underſtood by all Mankind: 'tis well however, you dare not ſay Rhimes, Meaſures or Tunes are unlawful. We will not ſay as well as you, Rhime is Eſſential to it: but if it be a Pſalm, Hymn or Song, and yet not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179241:11"/>Metre, or meaſur'd feet, we and all Mankind are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally miſtaken, for we know not how Proſe differs from Metre any other ways; but if there may be a melodious modulation of the Voice, or a proper ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Metre, we will not contend about that; and if you can ſing that way, pray uſe your liberty; but ſince Rhime, meaſures and Tunes are not unlawful, (as you poſitively affirm they are not) you ought to leave us to our liberty, and not condemn that as an invention of men, or an Error, which we perceive you dare not do, becauſe you know in the Original the Book of Pſalms, part of <hi>Job, Hannah's</hi> and <hi>Deborah's</hi> Songs, <hi>Prov. Eccleſ.</hi> &amp; <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Song of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the <hi>Lamentations</hi> and <hi>Habbukkuk,</hi> &amp;c. are in Metre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But why may we not ſing with meaſur'd feet? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Your firſt reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe you ſay thtre is no Rule in the New Teſtament enjoyning them, nor any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for ſuch a practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is a Rule in the New Teſtament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning ſinging Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs: And from thence we thus reaſon, If the Church knows no other ſinging of Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch a way, <hi>viz.</hi> in Metre, as was uſed under the old Teſtament, then that way the Churches are to ſing, but the former is true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Pſalms, Hymns, or Songs differ only from Proſe, becauſe they are in Metre, and this too in the common underſtanding of all men, then the Pſalm, Hymn, or Song is or muſt be in Metre, or meaſur'd feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is ſung, or elſe 'tis no Hymn or Song at all, but only in conceit and fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas, as you ask, whether a perſon cannot be merry in the Lord, expreſs his Joy in Praiſe and Thankſgiving with chearful Voice, without ſuch an Artificial Compoſure before mentioned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We do not deny but a perſon may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Lord, and expreſs his Joy in Praiſe and Thankſgiving with a chearful Voice too, and yet not ſing the Praiſes of God; what tho we that way do
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179241:11"/>and are to rejoyce, yet ought we not to leave the other undone, <hi>viz.</hi> to expreſs our Joy when merry in the Lord by ſinging, becauſe we are enjoyned by the Lord to ſing and make melody; will you teach and inſtruct the Almighty? What, ſays ſome, can't we Worſhip God without going into the water and be baptized, or remember Chriſts Death without breaking Bread, and drinking Wine. Take heed, dear Brother, ſinging the Praiſes of God is enjoyned on us, and on the Churches of Chriſt, 'tis not left to our liberty, whether we will do it or not: And other praiſing of God with chearful voice muſt not exclude this way, nor can it without Sin in neglect of a holy Duty. And Brother, you have no more reaſon to call it an artificial compoſure, than ſo to call our compoſed Sermons. The Prophet had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant compoſed voice in Preaching, ſo have ſome now, but muſt they be charged with an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial compoſure; who gave man that melodious tongue but God, and was it to any other deſign think you than to ſing forth his praiſe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ſay, <hi>If thoſe things (that is Metre, Verſe and Tune) be eſſential, then this Singing would be more a Natural Art, or rather an Artificial acquired attainment than a Spiritual gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer, Natural Art, and Natural Gifts are from God, as Speech, or to ſpeak, is given to us by him: 'Tis moreover an Ordinance to read God's Word, and an abſolute Duty, and yet it can't be attained without Art, and barely to read is more an Artificial acquired attainment than a Spiritual; ſo is it barely to ſing, and to preach, pray, and hear too; but to read, to pray, to preach, and to ſing Spiritually, can't be done without Spiritual gifts, for without Grace in the Heart, none of thoſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Moral and Artificial acquired attainments can be performed acceptably to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>Then the Melody would be as much in the Voice or Tune, as in the Heart, contrary to</hi> Eph. 5.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:179241:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Melody ought to be in the Heart according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and in the Voice too, or elſe it could not be ſinging; 'tis not to be a melody with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Voice, but if it be only in the Voice, and no Spiritual Melody in the Heart, then 'tis, we grant, contrary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. Doth not your ſuppoſed way of ſinging with chearful Voice, conſiſt as well in the Voice as in the Heart.</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt tells us, when God brought back the Captivity of <hi>Sion,</hi> He filled their mouths with laughter, and their Tongues with ſinging. Singing is only an act of the Tongue or Voice, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Laſtly you ſay, <q>There be ſuch Speeches recorded in Scripture, which are and may be called Songs of praiſe, which we do not find were uttered with tune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Singing, but with an audible ſolemn chearful Voice, as that which is called the Song of <hi>Hannah, &amp;c.</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why do you aſſert any ſuch things? if they praiſed God in a Song, they ſung the praiſes of God; but they praiſed God in a Song, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſung his praiſe; this muſt be granted, unleſs you can prove any did praiſe God in a Song without Singing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this be not ſo, the propriety of Speech, or acts of the bodily Organs are confounded, and we left in the dark, and the common Underſtanding of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind deceived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thô 'tis not ſaid they ſung thoſe Songs, yet their Singing of them is directly implyed, becauſe they praiſed God and magnified him in Songs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You know thoſe Songs in the Original are in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: Were you not a Scholar, we ſhould not ſo much admire at your miſtake; it was no proper Song they praiſed God in, if it were not ſung, and none dare ſay that thoſe are metaphorically called Songs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But you muſt conclude they were Tropical and Metaphorical Songs, or elſe believe they in a proper ſence, according to the common Underſtanding of Man.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179241:12"/>kind in general, did ſing thoſe Songs. To conclude with this Head, <hi>viz.</hi> What Singing is? all men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Trumpet gives in this matter an uncertain found, for one while you intimate 'tis praiſing of God in Prayer, another while you ſuggeſt you wait for a ſpecial gift, to perform it according to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive platform.</p>
            <p>And after all, do not ſay 'tis a muſical melodious modulation, or tuning of the Voice, thô but of one ſingle perſon alone, which is the diſtinction of that diſtinct act of the voice known to the common race of mankind.</p>
            <p>So that when that Gift is attained you wait for, we know not what a ſort of Singing we ſhall have: But the Word of God hath not left us thus in the dark about what it is to ſing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Learned Men affirm 'tis an act of the voice, which all men know how it differs from any other act of the bodily Organs, as Prayer, common prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, rejoycing, preaching, crying, ſhouting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it alſo clearly appears from <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That 'tis clearly diſtinguiſhed from the Duty of Prayer, as another diſtinct act, by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will pray with the underſtanding alſo, I will ſing with the Spirit, and will ſing with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo.</hi> Common praiſe is by all confeſſed to be a part or branch of Prayer, and comprehended in prayer, and therefore that is not ſinging; the ſame we have laid down by the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In a word, 'tis we ſay again a muſical melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious praiſing of God, which had you affirmed, you had not left your people in the dark about it, as now you have. But to proceed, we ſhall referr our Reader for his further ſatisfaction concerning this to Mr. <hi>Keach</hi>'s Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 'Tis called the <hi>making a joyful noiſe to the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 81.1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 'tis ſaid thoſe that ſhall ſing thoſe <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> ſhall make a noiſe as of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179241:13"/>great Thunder, which can't be the voice of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhall come to examine that which in page 5. you call the order or manner of Singing, which you ſay we are plainly directed unto, by what is recorded in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. From <hi>26th.</hi> Verſe you ſay it is a gift of the Holy Spirit beſtowed on whom and when he pleaſes, for the Edification of the Church, and that the Pſalm was to be uttered or ſung by him that had it ſingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it was to be uttered or ſpoken forth by one ſingly, is granted, but that it was ſung by him alone ſingly, we deny; the reaſon you give for your bold aſſertion follows in the ſaid fifth page of your Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For, or becauſe they were ſo to propheſie, <hi>viz.</hi> one by one, the ſame direction being given you ſay, for expreſſing or ſinging of a Pſalm, <hi>verſe</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Brother, why did you not rehearſe that 29, 30, 31. verſes, for had you ſo done, all who read your Epiſtle might ſee what you ſay is not true, there is nothing expreſſed or ſpoken in <hi>verſe</hi> 28, 29, 30, 31, about ſinging at all.</p>
            <p>We will give the Reader the trouble to read the Verſe which our Brother affirms this aſſertion from, and let it be conſidered. This Text had need to be plain for his purpoſe, becauſe he cites no other place of Scripture for what he ſays, but this one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prove that one ſingle perſon ſhould ſing in the Church alone; <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the others judge,</hi> ver. 29. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that fitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace,</hi> ver. 30. <hi>For ye may all Propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> ver. 31.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the verſes from whence Mr. <hi>Steed</hi> affirms the Apoſtle gives directions about ſinging one by one, as in the caſe of prophecying: But how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is miſtaken, will appear.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:179241:13"/>
            <p n="1">1. For 'tis plain from hence, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks only of prophecying or preaching, and not of Singing: And evident it is, that but one ſingle perſon at once ought to preach, prophecy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scripture, and this direction the Apoſtle gives about the exerciſe of thoſe gifts, becauſe the contrary is confuſion all the World knows.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not confuſion for two, three, or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore to ſing together, for if it were, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the whole Congregation, and Chriſt and his Diſciples performed a confuſed piece of Worſhip, which is Blaſphemy to aſſert.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay it is poſitively aſſerted by the Holy Spirit, that to do otherwiſe is not <hi>order</hi> but <hi>confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which the All-wiſe God <hi>is not the Author of:</hi> ver. 33. From this Rule it is, ſay you, that our Prayers, our Doctrines and Exhortations are uttered ſingly in the Churches.</p>
            <p>And that we do not admit of thoſe reſponſes or repetitions with audible voice of the multitude in Prayer, which are allowed of, and practiſed in ſome Proteſtant Aſſemblies, ſhall we admit of this Rule, to guide us in ſome Caſes, and deny it in others? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle condemns that practice, as being confuſion, which ſeemed to be ſo by Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as well as Believers, and ſo by all men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and ſuch a practice, which if the Church allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if Unbelievers come into their Aſſemblies they would ſay, Are they not mad? And ſo indeed they might ſay, ſhould they ſee ſeveral together at one time a preaching, propheſying, or interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or vocally praying together: But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look'd upon by <hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a great multitude to ſing together, for ſo the Lords People, <hi>viz. Iſrael</hi> of old ſung, and ſo ſung the Heathen Nations to their Gods, therefore this of ſinging together could not be intended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can any Man be ſo blind to think there was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179241:14"/>ſuch a practice that was confuſion in Gods Worſhip under the Law, for you will not deny but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites or the Prieſthood then ſung together in their courſes, in which was typified, ſome conclude, the whole Spiritual Prieſthood under the Goſpel, or the whole Church ſinging together with Grace in their Hearts unto the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since the Scripture you bring doth not prove what you affirm, in the Judgment of all wiſe Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, but is only your ovvn Interpretation of it: And ſince no Scripture is of a private Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, We Exhort you in God's Fear to prove this your Expoſition of it by ſome other place or places of the Holy Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Shew, where ever any one Man ſingly alone did ever ſing, or was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved ſo to do in God's ordinary Worſhip, either in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in the Goſpel-Church; which if you cannot do, your Interpretation is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rejected. You know, Honoured Brother, this is the ſame Argument we uſe to Detect Men in other Caſes, when they put their own private ſenſe on any Text, which they cannot prove from any other place of ſacred Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Your fourth Reaſon for one ſingle Perſons ſinging, is taken from <hi>Ver.</hi> 34. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let your Women keep ſilent in the Church, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak, but they are Commanded to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> About this we argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Since in your Judgment the Apoſtle had excluded Men to ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Church, and that they were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſing, but only one ſingly alone, the Women were much more, you may conclude, had that been his ſence forbidden, and ſo no room left to ſubjoyn this Prohibition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the Context and Scope of the Text opens what the Apoſtle intends, he is a treating about Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying or Teaching doctrinally in the Church, and gives liberty to all gifted Men ſo to do, provided they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179241:14"/>did it in order, <hi>viz.</hi> One by One: But leaſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould conclude who had the Gift of Prophecy or Teaching they might uſe that Gift, and take upon them to Teach or Exerciſe Authority over the Men, the Apoſtle layes dovvn this Prohibition, they muſt not be permitted in a Miniſterial way, to Preach or Teach in the Church in ordinary Adminiſtration, but be in Obedience or Subjection, as ſaith alſo the Law: So that it appears 'tis no other Prohibition on Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than what was under the Law, therefore extends not to prohibit them from ſinging, for they were ſuffered ſo to do then; <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Deborah</hi> ſung in the Congregation, and 'tis left to their Praiſe and Commendation; ſo that from what you ſay in the laſt place, <hi>p.</hi> 6. as to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that all this is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſolemn awful Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignifies nothing to confute ſinging of a multitude together, though Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prophecy, or Interpreting the Scriptures together in a diſorderly and confuſed manner, is here forbidden.</p>
            <p>And that this is the abſolute ſence and meaning of the Apoſtle on this place, we averr is confirmed by all the learned, beſt and moſt faithful-Expoſitors and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notators that ever wrote; we know none diſſent, or are of your Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Say you, Thus briefly having declar'd what Singing is, and how a Pſalm or Spiritual Song, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of our Lord Jeſus ought to be brought in the Church, it from hence plainly, you ſay, appears, what manner of Singing is not his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> 
               <q>That common Singing of a mixt multitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſiſting of Church-Members; and hearers good and bad, Men, Women and Children, Profeſſors and Prophane together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You draw this Concluſion too ſoon; for there ſeems no one Argument againſt ſuch a ſinging yet, but you add then in the next place,</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:179241:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You ſay it was never ſo appointed for a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> where there were Inſtruments of Muſick and Singers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are done away in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> As to ſinging Praiſes to God with Voices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a mixt Congregation, that was a Duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Lords <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Law was given forth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 2. and therefore though Muſick and Singing-men ceaſed when Chriſt came, yet ſinging did not ceaſe, becauſe, as the Brethren have proved, it is part of Moral and Natural Religion, and therefore a ſtanding Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe 'twas Practiſed by Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in a Goſpel-Congregation, with Voices toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe 'tis enjoyned on the Goſpel-Church without any New Directions given about it, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating it to the Miniſtry only, or ſome one gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon, who was to ſing by immediate Inſpiration, as you conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſay it is moſt evident that now in the Goſpel-times there is no ſuch Inſtitution of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doth it, you ſay, comport with his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſpenſation, who hath appointed his Church-Ordinances to be adminiſtred by none but ſuch who are orderly added to the Church, and qualified by the Gifts of the Holy Spirit for it, being ſolemnly allowed or orderly called to ſuch an Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is an Inſtitution now in theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel times to ſing Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and therefore it comports with this Spiritual Diſpenſation; as touching ſinging in a mixt Congregation, wherein the controverſie lyes, it ſeems you ſo ſing as well as others, for if you do not ſing in a mixt Congregregation with profeſſors and prophane, you do not ſing in the Church at all. Brother, take heed leaſt you condemn the thing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179241:15"/>which you allow; do you ſing or not in the Church? You intimate <hi>page</hi> 2. 'tis a falſe Calumny or accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay you do not, pray then conſider whether you do not ſuffer others in prayer to ſing with you in your ſence, nay all that will. Alſo you ſay, when one ſings all may be ſaid to ſing, as in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But may be you will ſay, they do not joyn their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Brother, is not their joyning their Hearts in your ſinging as you call it more in the ſight of God, than a bare joyning the voice; 'tis expreſt <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. in the Heart as well as with the Voice. Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, and blame us no more for pleading for ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a mixt multitude.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are none but ſuch who are orderly added to the Church, and qualified by the Gifts of the Holy Spirit allowed to worſhip God with the Church? Then you are a grievous Offendor, for we are ſure you never worſhip God in his Church in any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Ordinance ſave breaking of Bread, but all in your Aſſemblies are allowed or ſuffered to worſhip God with you: Is not hearing God's Word and Prayer ſpiritual Goſpel Ordinances? in the laſt you think you ſing too, and do not your Congregation, when you perform theſe Duties, conſiſt of Church Members good and bad, Men, and Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, profeſſors and prophane together, and are not theſe Ordinances of our Lord Jeſus?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why may we ſuffer others to pray and praiſe God with us, and not ſuffer them to ſing his praiſe with us?</p>
            <p n="4">4. You betray your Goſpel Simplicity, we fear, by this Objection, ſince you do not allow of proper ſinging by the Church alone: we ſhould think you made a more honeſt ſcruple in the caſe if you were for the Churches ſinging alone; but you are againſt the Saints ſinging apart, as much as their ſinging with others.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:179241:16"/>
            <p n="5">5. Where have we a Rule to put the Hearers out of our Aſſemblies when we are met to worſhip God? or to command them not to joyn their Hearts in Prayer with us, or their Voices and Hearts in ſinging Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Sure if it had been unlawful, we ſhould have had ſome Directions in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We do not joyn with them in prayer, nor ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thô they joyn with us; we will not ſuffer them to bring forth a Pſalm or a Doctrine that are not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no more than to make them our mouth in prayer.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If they are enjoyned to pray and praiſe God, and ſing his praiſe too, thô they cannot do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably without holy habits, and the exerciſe of Faith, then it can be no fault in us to ſuffer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſo to do: but the former you cannot deny, therefore we cannot be faulty to permit them ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Singing of Pſalms is full of Admonition and Spiritual Inſtruction, and ſome we can aſſure you have been wrought upon by their ſinging, ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it hath had upon their Souls; and ſhall we debarr them of ſuch a precious Ordinance, that God has bleſſed to the Converſion of ſome Sinners Souls.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 7. you ſay, <hi>This Common way of Singing is an invention ſuited to the humane Conſtituiion of a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, where Believers and Unbelievers, Light and Darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial are put together,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be an Invention, pray who invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and in what Age of the World was it done? certainly you muſt charge it upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the firſt we read of who put a mixt Congregation upon Singing the praiſes of God: you forget your ſelf we fear, our dear Brother, for you cannot deny but that Congregation did ſo ſing, yea, and a mixt Congregation it was alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thô in cloſe Communion, in breaking of Bread, we are to ſeparate our ſelves from Unbelievers, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179241:16"/>muſt have no fellowſhip with them; Yet a Goſpel Church is not to ſeparate in time of other Goſpel Duties and Ordinances from ſuch, nor do you call upon yours ſo to do; pray Brother change your thoughts, and do not fight againſt the Truth, for you cannot ſtand before it, 'tis too ſtrong to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by fancies and fictions of Mens Minds.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>pag.</hi> 7. you are bold again to affirm, <hi>That Singing of compoſed Songs by all the Members of a Church, both Men and Women lifting up their Voices together, is not an Ordinance of our Lord Jeſus:</hi> Your further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You ſay, <hi>Becauſe there is no ſuch thing appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, or recorded ſo to be in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Churches are commanded by the Holy Ghoſt to ſing Scripture-pſalms, Hymns and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs without exception: And this is recorded <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. We argue, that either the whole Church muſt ſing all together, or elſe only ſome of them, or one ſingle perſon only.</p>
            <p>But ſince they are all enjoyned to ſing, or the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is required of the whole Church without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not tyed or limited to any perſon or perſons in particular, it follows, they are all to Sing, and ſo to Sing as the Lords People ſung under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and Chriſt and his Diſciples, who ſung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had it been limited to the Elder, or ſome gilted perſon, we may be ſure the Holy Ghoſt would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven directions in the caſe, or hinted at ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the ſecond place you hint, <hi>the whole Church, with every Member, had Communion together ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Pattern, and wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, is expreſly declared to be</hi> in the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowſhip, breaking of Bread and Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>Here you ſay is not the leaſt mention of their ſinging together, which if it had been practiſed in thoſe times, as it is now by many, would it not have bin expreſſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Brother, you confeſs Singing is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179241:17"/>that was practiſed in the primitive Church, thô as you conceive by one ſingle perſon only: Now if ſo, how comes it to paſs this Argument of yours has any weight in it, ſince there is no more mention of one ſingle perſons ſinging than of the whole Churches? this is againſt any ſinging, and ſo againſt yours, as much as againſt that we contend for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dear Brother, you forget that Singing of Pſalms was part of the Apoſtles Doctrine, and that they taught the Churches ſo to ſing; we argue thus, If the Apoſtle taught the whole Church to ſing, then ſuch a ſinging was part of their Doctrine in which they continued: But the Apoſtles taught the whole Church to ſing, <hi>Ergo,</hi> that was part of their Doctrine, in which that Church continued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>You object againſt the whole Church to ſing, becauſe Women are plainly forbidden to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>ſay you, to utter a Doctrine, or a Pſalm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have ſhewed your miſtake in this; a Woman is only prohibited from teaching or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, ſhe muſt not exerciſe authority over the Man. For to teach Authoritatively hath that contained in it; they are not forbidden to ſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under the Law they were (as we ſaid before) permitted ſo to do, and they are not denyed any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Goſpel Church, which they had and might have under the Law in that caſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You argue againſt ſuch ſinging, <hi>Becauſe every Member of the Church, you ſay, is not capable to be exerciſed in that common way of Singing, for ſome have, you ſay, not a tuneable Voice, or natural Faculty of Singing, ſome may not underſtand immediately that compoſed Song read to them, may not be in a joyful frame, and ſo cannot ſing all together with the Spirit, and Underſtanding, as is required,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not believe any one Member is totally without a tuneable Voice, or the faculty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Singing, thô ſome may not have it to that degree o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> acuteneſs as ſome others, no more than they may in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179241:17"/>Prayer; yet ſuch who can't pray ſo elequently, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutely expreſs themſelves, ought to pray nevertheleſs as well as they can, and ſo in Singing they may do it as well as they can.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are all to joyn in Prayer in their Hearts with the Miniſter; but may be ſome may not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately underſtand ſome of the expreſſions their Miniſters uſe, and ſo with the Spirit and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can't joyn in Prayer in their Hearts, and ſo with you in your way of ſinging.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such who cannot, may forbear either joyning in ſuch Expreſſions either with you, or us; and ſuch who are not in a joyful frame may forbear too; we do not believe every one muſt ſing always with the Church, or they ſin: But thô they may not be in a joyful frame, God nevertheleſs deſerves his praiſes, and he is in a very bad frame indeed that is out of a frame to laud and praiſe the Name of God: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bids us rejoyce evermore, and thô ſorrowful, yet always rejoycing in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>You ſay Singing is to be practiſed as that it may be for teaching and admoniſhing one another; therefore,</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>ſome are to teach, and ſome to be taught: are all Teachers and all Admoniſhers at one time, but none taught, which is confuſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the way, this ſhews Singing is not part of Prayer, or praiſing of God in Prayer; ſure you do not uſe Prayer to teach or admoniſh one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pſalm hath the teaching and admoniſhing in it, and all in ſinging Pſalms may be ſaid to teach, and yet all by the Pſalm are taught and admoniſhed. And ſince God hath commanded us to teach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another, <hi>viz. In Pſalms, Hymns and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs, ſinging and making melody in our Hearts to the Lord;</hi> how dare you contradict it, or oppoſe our ſo doing? 'Tis a different way of teaching one another, than in the way of a Miniſters preaching, and yet it is no confuſion; 'tis a teaching and admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179241:18"/>in ſinging of Pſalms; and how all may be ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in ſo doing to teach, and yet be taught, ſee Mr, <hi>Keaches</hi> Book, <hi>page</hi> 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120. Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſing together, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1? and were they not all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs by that Song admoniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was that confuſion?</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, if a Preacher ſhould teach the people, by uttering or ſpeaking out a ſentence of his Sermon, and all his hearers ſhould ſay it or ſing it after him, and ſo proceed, would this, ſay you, be reputed an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way for the inſtruction and edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? So that this Scripture which is ſo frequently alledged to countenance common Singing, is a plain and evident witneſs, ſay you, againſt it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> How many ſentences of a Sermon may be contained in one or more of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, which Pſalm may be, and oft times is ſung after the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is ended, and yet the People may be ſweetly, and in an orderly way inſtructed and edified thereby? for did not Gods people of old thus ſing in the words of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Chron. 29.30? Dare you ſay that way which God hath taught and commanded his people to teach and admoniſh one another, may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an orderly way for inſtruction and edification of them? evident it is he hath commanded them to teach and admoniſh one another in Pſalms in ſinging, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We thus reaſon, Either the Apoſtle gives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach from, or out of Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to them to pray and praiſe God in prayer, or elſe he enjoyns them to be found in ſome other Ordinance or Duty, diſtinct or quite different from either of the other, namely, to ſing Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Now he can't intend Preaching, or Directions to Miniſters, becauſe he doth not ſay, Admoniſh one another from or out of Pſalms, but in Pſalms. Nor is there any ſhadow of reaſon why the Apoſtle ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179241:18"/>give particular Directions to Miniſters to Preach out of the Pſalms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe in the ſame breath, as we may ſay, he exhorts them to ſing; ſo that according to all wiſe and worthy Expoſitors, he means no other Teaching than that which is in ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe he doth not direct his words to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but to the whole Church, even to all that are to be filled with the Spirit, and to have the Word of Chriſt to dwell richly in them, which is every Man and Womans Duty; all that were or are filled with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, or who have true Grace in their Hearts, or have cauſe to rejoyce in God, are required to ſing Pſalms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot intend Prayer, or Praiſing of God in Prayer, becauſe thereby we only ſpeak to God, and not to Teach and Admoniſh one another. If we are no where in Holy Scripture ſaid in Prayer, or Praiſing of God in Prayer, to Teach and Admoniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſuch an Expoſition is to be exploded as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; but in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are no where ſaid to Teach or Admoniſh one another:</p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt intend ſome other Duty or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that is diſtinct or different to both the former, <hi>Viz.</hi> That of Teaching and Admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, by ſinging of them together.</p>
            <p>So that in oppoſition to what you ſay, theſe places ſo frequently alledged do not only countenance that which you call common ſinging, but poſitively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns it on the Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 
               <q>This common way of Singing, you ſay, cannot be allowed in the Church, becauſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cannot by lifting up their Voices ſing together, but it muſt be by ſome compoſed ſet ſtinted form of ſome ones making, which they muſt have read to them, or they muſt read it themſelves line after line, and ſo to ſing (ſay you) doth not appear to be the Mind and Will of our Lord Jeſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> Are not the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and other
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179241:19"/>Scripture Songs ſet and ſtinted Forms? and becauſe they are ſo, muſt they not be allowed in the Church? God, it appears, doth enjoyn them, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them tho' you will not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But why muſt they be compoſed Forms of ſome ones making? hath not the Holy Ghoſt left us in the Holy Scripture, Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs? we plead for no other Pſalms but ſuch that are of the Spirits compoſing, or compoſed by the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſee where your ſore is, you are for Singing by Inſpiritation, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſalms given immediately by ſome ſpecial Gift, and hence are againſt the whole Churches Singing; becauſe if you ſhould have ſuch a ſpecial Pſalm to bring forth, others you foreſee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſing with you; but the ſame Pſalm you muſt read or pronounce to them, and ſo it would be a ſtinted Form to others as well as Scripture-pſalms are ſo. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how could all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Sing with <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he did not, or ſome others, read or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce each line to them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. But why do you ſay ſo to ſing doth not appear to be the Mind and Will of God? you proceed, and ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>Becauſe he never appointed or commanded that one perſon ſhould write or indite a Prayer or Song for another; nor did he promiſe a Bleſſing to them in their ſo doing in his New Teſtament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> God hath appointed and commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſing Pſalms, Hymns or Spiritual Songs, which are left on record in the Scripture as to the matter of them; and he has as much appointed one perſon to ſet them in order to be ſung, as he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or commanded any perſon to indite a Sermon to preach it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In vain is all you ſpeak, about writing or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting prayers for another; for God himſelf hath made, appointed and given us a book of Pſalms, but no ſuch Common-prayer-book: Had the Holy Ghoſt compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Form of Prayers, as he hath a Form of Pſalms, and commanded us ſo to pray, as he hath enjoyned us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179241:19"/>ſo to ſing, muſt we have rejected them? Singing of Pſalms is of Divine Authority, ſay you what you pleaſe, if our Bible be of Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, <q>You ſay ſuch ſinging doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the Will of God, becauſe the Lord hath expreſly declared, that this Religious Singing-ought to proceed from the Word <hi>dwelling richly in them,</hi> Col. 3.16. And <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 5.18. Now, ſay you, if they may or ought to ſing by a ſet, ſtinted, compoſed form that is before them, it is then but reading or hearing of a Pſalm or a Song read to them, and then they are ſufficiently furniſhed for this ſolemn work, thô they are never ſo empty of the Word of Truth, or deſtitute of the Spirit, or indeed groſly ignorant, which is in downright terms to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Counſel and Command of the Soveraign Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> 'Tis well you do acknowledge there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſinging: But Brother, who of us plead for ſuch a carnal empty ſort of Singing as you ſpeak of? Do we in order to a Religlous Singing, ſay there needs no more but the knowledge of the matter to be ſung, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pſalm to be read to us? we ſay all that ſing ought to ſing with the Spirit, and with Grace in their Hearts: So that here you beat the Air, for we deteſt ſuch a Singing which you mention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As touching the Word of Chriſt dwelling rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in us, to which you might have added <hi>in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in thoſe who ſing Spiritually, 'tis abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: But pray remember, 'tis the Word of Chriſt we have upon record, 'tis not ſome new inſpired matter immediately given in, nor doth ſinging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more of that Soul-enriching, indwelling Word of Chriſt, than in Preaching, Prayer, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Word of Chriſt ought to dwell in us richly in all wiſdom, as Dr. <hi>Wright</hi> ſhews, that ſo we may know when and how to pray, when and what to preach,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179241:20"/>when and how to hear, when and how to read, when and how to meditate, and when and how Spiritually to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, or other Scripture Hymns and Spiritual Songs. Many excellent Duties, as he ſhews <hi>p.</hi> 63. may be ſpoiled in the obſervation of them; there may be a <hi>praying</hi> which is ſin, <hi>reading</hi> and not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>hearing</hi> a favour of death, <hi>partaking of the Lords Supper</hi> to Judgment, <hi>giving all to the poor,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing, and a ſinging of Gods praiſes, and ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his works, or without Grace in the Heart, or be ignorant of the Soul-enriching Word, and deſtitute of the Spirit: Therefore as Singing, ſo all other Duties ought to be performed in the Spirit, and with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Grace in the Heart to the Lord: and to a right ſinging of Scripture-pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis needful the Word of Chriſt dwell in us richly in all wiſdom, not as touching the bringing forth of a Pſalm, as to the matter of it, ſo much as to a Spiritual ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Pſalm with Grace, Wiſdom, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences. Singing Pſalms, ſaith he, is to be reverently performed for God's Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not for the pleaſing our ſelves: So that one muſt ſuit his inward Thoughts to the matter; if it be of <hi>praiſe</hi> to God, our Hearts muſt be elevated and chearful; if in the Pſalm or Hymn, <hi>Petitions</hi> be contained, fervent; if <hi>threatning,</hi> great awe of God; if <hi>deliverance,</hi> raiſed hope; if <hi>Judgment,</hi> fear; if <hi>Duty,</hi> holy purpoſe to obey; if <hi>Promiſes,</hi> to believe; if <hi>Prophecy,</hi> expectation: Thus the Word in all wiſdom ſhould dwell in us, that ſo we may know how to ſing to the Glory of God, and our own Inſtruction, Comfort and Conſolation as in other Duties. Some have lately told you, that the Word of Chriſt is to be in us richly, as well to help us to compile a Scripture Hymn, as to compile a Scripture Sermon; but we conclude it ought to dwell in all richly as in one, not ſo much (as we ſaid afore) to bring forth a Pſalm, as to a right Spiritual ſinging of Pſalms, Hymns and Divine Songs. 'Tis a great miſtake to ſuppoſe the Spirit
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179241:20"/>ought ſo to dwell richly in us, as immediately to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us to bring forth a Pſalm both Matter, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Tune in an extraordinary ſort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe we are exhorted to let it dwell in us richly, 'tis preſs'd upon the Saints in general as their Duty, ſo to be filled with it; ſpecial Gifts were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to ſome, and not taught as a Duty to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by all, but as a promiſe, given to ſome in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as the Spirit diſtributed to every man that had them as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor can it be proved the matter of the Pſalm ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was immediateiy given when they were met together. But they had a Doctrine, had a Pſalm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when firſt they came together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>How is it brethren? when you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. they were not to wait for them, but had them ready; ſo that the Church was not at uncertainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, which might be a Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi> we reading of no other ſo called; and they might bring it forth in ſome extraordinary manner, and may be in an unknown Tongue, which they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do, unleſs there was an Interpreter, that ſo others might joyn with him that had it: For that word, <hi>When I pray, I will pray with the Spirit, and with the Underſtanding alſo,</hi> doth not mean only when he was alone, but when in the Church, that others might pray with him; and ſo he would when he ſung, <hi>Sing with the Spirit, and with the understanding alſo;</hi> not only when alone, but alſo in the Church, that others might ſing with him. And ſince we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of any one Mans ſinging alone in any Church-Aſſembly, we do affirm, ſuch a practice would be a meer Humane Innovation, and to be abominated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You ſay, <q>If ſinging be principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a ſolemn praiſing of God, which praiſing is the higheſt ſervice we can perform to him, it moſt naturally and directly tending to the honour of his Glorious Name: If then (ſay you) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,

            <p n="2">2. You would have a Pſalm given by immediate Inſpiration, and ſo ſung by a ſpecial Gift, or you would have none at all: we know none of your mind, and of the Mind of your party, except thoſe called the ſweet Singers of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we poſitively deny there were ever any ſuch Pſalms brought into the Churches of Chriſt, and do require you to give us but one example of ſuch a bringing forth of a Pſalm, <hi>viz.</hi> the matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Tune, and all by immediate Inſpiration, or ſpecial gift, and ſung by one Man alone, for we have ſhewed that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. proves no ſuch thing. Alſo we would know if there ſhould be ſuch Pſalms gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now, or hereafter, as you hint there were in the Apoſtolical Church, whether ſuch Pſalms would not be of equal Authority to Canonical Scripture? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were there ſuch Pſalms then given; how comes it to paſs we have them not left in Gods Word, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have others left on record?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But could you prove ſome did bring forth ſuch Pſalms, by a ſpecial Gift, in the Goſpel day, what would that ſigniſie, ſince it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and could not be denyed but they brought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179241:21"/>forth their Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo, by the ſame mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and extraordinary Spirit, and we muſt no more attempt to preach without ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gift, than not to ſing Pſalms without the ſaid extraordinary and ſpecial Gift, but muſt throw off all Ordinances till thoſe Gifts return: if what you ſay be true,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why do you ſay Prayer is a lower ſort of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than Singing, we utterly deny it: What Duty is more ſublime of ſacred than right Spiritual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? But tho' prayer be ſo great a Duty, and we have no ſtinted Forms left for it, yet in ſinging, which is alſo a great Goſpel Duty, we have a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Form mentioned. A pſalm can't be a pſalm, as we told you once already, without a ſet and ſtinted Form; all alſo may pray together without a ſtinted Form, but all cannot ſing together without they know the ſet Pſalm, Hymn and Spiritual Song: So that from the Nature of Singing, or how it differs from prayer, we argue, there is a neceſſity of the one and not of the other. Could the Diſciples have ſung that Hymn with Chriſt unleſs the matter ſung were ſpoken out, or pronounced to them? Therefore tho' we condemn as well as you the compoſing, uſing and impoſing ſet Forms of Prayer, yet we ſhew and prove that ſet Forms of Singing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, and other Scripture Hymns compoſed by the Holy Spirit, are of Divine Inſtitution; and hereby we do not contradict our Teſtimony againſt the former ſort of Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>page</hi> 8. of your Epiſtle. And from hence in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to what you there ſay, we affirm, this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of yours carries no weight nor demonſtration in it at all, againſt that you call the common way of Singing. Nor do we give up the Cauſe in the leaſt, for which we have ſuffered in teſtifying againſt a Form of humane Antichriſtian or Popiſh prayers. Nor is our alledging againſt you, that liberty which you may, and many pious Miniſters do take in compoſing a ſet and ſtinted form of preaching without force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179241:22"/>for we affirm, and will, God aſſiſting, maintain it, there is to every degree as much ground for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to object againſt ſetting (by careful ſtudy) as the Spirit ſhall enable us, a ſet Form of a Sermon to be preached, as there is for you to condemn the compoſing or ſetting in order by the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a Scripture-pſalm, Hymn, or Spiritual Song to be ſung: To ſay Preachers do not confine themſelves to that ſet Form they have ſtudied, we ſay is not true of many of them, tho' may be you do not ſo confine your ſelf; and will you affirm they that do ſo, do not preach Spiritually, but by a humane ſtinted form; we muſt aſſure you ſhould you ſo ſpeak, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get another controverſie as hot as this; and what will the effects of your Eſſay be, think you, in the end, ſhould you thus proceed? is the Sermon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane if every word be pre meditated, that he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards delivers? And may not a Miniſter preach over again the ſame Sermon, <hi>verbatim,</hi> to another Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and be juſtified: See that place <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42.</p>
            <p>The true ſtate of the Caſe depending is this, <hi>viz.</hi> preaching is Gods Ordinance, but no particular ſet ſtinted Form or method of preaching is laid down in the Goſpel. Therefore let us not condemn one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but leave each man to his liberty, ſo be he preaches, and the like alſo in ſinging, provided ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not wholly omitted from ſuch groundleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, or a practice brought in the room of it that never was uſed in Gods Church. None ſound in the Faith pretend to preach by immediate Inſpiration, or by an extraordinary Gift, but by the ordinary Gifts, by ſtudying the Mediate written word, and the Spirit may help us to ſtudy, and pre-meditate every word we intend to ſpeak, and yet our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be Spiritual, and be as ſucceſsful as if we ſtudied not, but ſpeak only what comes into our Minds when we deliver it; nay, and how unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and confuſed generally ſuch Mens preaching is,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179241:22"/>all Men know, who preach extemporally: ſo Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Gods Ordinance, but none who are ſound in the Faith pretend to ſing Pſalms by immediate Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor is there any more ground to wait for a ſpecial gift to ſing than to preach; and how confuſed ſuch extemporary Singing might be, all may foreſee: 'Tis eaſie to pretend to a Gift, and ſo deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as ſome do, who pretend they preach by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inſpiration. And unleſs the perſon can work Miracles to prove he ſings by an immediate Spirit, or a ſpecial Gift, who would believe him? nay, and there is more ground for a ſet, ſtinted Form of ſinging than of preaching, becauſe the Scripture-pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs are left in Gods Word as ſet, and ſtinted pre-compoſed Forms, and cannot be without ſuch Forms; 'tis a ſmall variation to put the Scripture-Pſalm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Metre, without which they could not be melodiouſly ſung ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Precept, and the proper Nature of Singing: it ſeems to us that you would have ſuch a ſort of ſinging as the Quakers have of preaching. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Controverſie ſhould ariſe amongſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from what you ſay againſt ſinging, and ſome ſhould ſay there is no ground for a ſet, and ſtinted Form of preaching, but ſay preaching muſt be performed from a ſpecial immediate or extraordinary Gift, as in the Apoſtles time, and ſo from thence will preach no more; they doubtleſs would have as much ground ſo to do as you have to caſt off or oppoſe all ſinging of Pſalms, from the fame foot of an account, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to wait for the return of thoſe Gifts that were in the Goſpel Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <q>You ſay you ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to thoſe Scriptures in the New Teſtament, which are alledged for this common ſinging; the firſt is that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.26. where <hi>it is ſaid, they ſung an Hymn,</hi> that is, Chriſt and his Diſciples after they had broke Bread, in Greek, they having hymned, from <hi>hymneo.</hi> Theſe Scriptures being the chief, you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179241:23"/>ſay, by the miſtaken apprehenſion of which this common ſinging is uſher'd in, and ſteals into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, you tell us you ſhall be the more large in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> 'Tis your miſtake, the chief Scriptures we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the Church to ſing together, are thoſe in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. which enjoyns ſinging, they are clear precepts; theſe are, 'tis true, the chief that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for ſinging after the Lords Supper.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>It is to be conſidered, ſay you, that ſeveral Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Expoſitors do aſſert, That this Hymn did belong to the Paſſeover, and not to the Supper, the Lords Supper being inſtituted before the whole Solemnity of the Paſſeover was finiſhed, with the Bread and Wine that was appointed for it: which being finiſhed, they concluded with an Hymn, as the Jews were wont to do at ſuch ſeaſons. If it then did appertain to the Paſſeover, it was done away with it,</hi> p. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Why did you not recite thoſe Learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors you mention? for thô we know and grant ſome learned Expoſitors do affirm, That the Jews ended their Paſſover by ſinging a Pſalm, yet they cannot prove what they ſay. Alſo we know none who ſay this Hymn which our Saviour and his Diſciples ſung, did appertain to the Paſſeover; nor do any Learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors aſſert one ſingle perſon alone ever ſung after the Lords Supper.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such a kind of Singing an Hymn you ſay, is not to be practiſed now, becauſe we find the uttering or ſinging of a Pſalm or Hymn in the Church, was by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord to be manag'd after another manner, as appears from the before mentioned,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26.</p>

            <p>Object. <hi>The ſecond Objection you pretend to anſwer, is that about</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas<hi>'s ſinging praiſe to God,</hi> Acts 16.25.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>To this, you ſay, <bibl>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 11.</bibl> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> pray'd as well as ſang praiſes, and were heard by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: Can we think, (ſay you) that when they prayed they ſpake both together? Why then ſhould any ſuppoſe they liſted up their Voices together in ſinging praiſes, the Holy Spirit gives no other account of the one than of the other?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We ſay to you in anſwer; why ſhould any think the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in the Clouds, or unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly? When they prayed no body doubts but that one only was the mouth; but if they both ſung, then one did not ſing alone, becauſe all Mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the act of Singing, as has been proved, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers quite from that of praying. Many may, we tell you again, be truly and properly ſaid to pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when only one is the mouth, but many cannot be ſaid to ſing together, if but one ſingle perſon only truly and properly ſings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore thô the priſoners heard them, 'tis not to be thought they heard both their Voices when they prayed, but yet did hear both their Voices when they ſung.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had it been no more than praiſing of God in Prayer, the Holy Ghoſt had not added, <hi>and ſung praiſes;</hi> ſtrange! you will diſtinguiſh no better on the Natures of differing Ordinances, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtanding of all Mankind! Do you always when you praiſe God, or give thanks for your meat and drink, before or after meat, ſing? would not any Body of underſtanding ſmile at you, ſhould you ſo ſpeak?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>You ſay we may ſafely conclude they did not ſing by lifting up their Voices together, becauſe we may judge that the Apoſtle knowing the Mind of the Lord in that particular, which he could and did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179241:28"/>communicate unto others, would not allow himſelf or this Companion to be tranſgreſſors of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> Dear Brother, you argue not at all; ſtrange! that ſuch lines ſhould come from ſuch a Pen: You take that for granted which you prove not, and which we deny by force of argument. We ſay the Apoſtle well knew ſinging with Voices together was the practice of the Lords people under the Law, and that ſo Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung, and therefore ſo he and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung, and were no tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſince <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who you ſay, knew the Mind of the Lord in that particular ſung, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we ſay ſo it is our Duty to do, and they that do it not, neglect a Goſpel Duty.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>The third Objection you pretend to anſwer, is from that in</hi> Jam. 5.13. Is any merry, let him ſing Pſams.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Scripture, you ſay, is no direction for a Church aſſembled to employ themſelves in ſinging together: But how a particular perſon in a joyful frame ought to manage his Mirth, or Comfort to the Glory of God. Certainly it can never be a right Inference, ſay you, that becauſe a ſingle perſon when chearful or comfortable, is exhorted to ſing praiſe to God, therefore to conclude, that it is the Duty of the Church of Chriſt in its publick Aſſembly to have all the Members ſing together with Artificial Rhimes, and Tunes, a compoſed Song, or Pſalm, tho not commanded ſo to do, and although they be not in a joyful frame, is a ſtrange inference.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> We in the firſt place cannot but obſerve how clearly you here give away the Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> do not you plainly intimate, that ſinging is a different thing from Prayer, or common ordinary praiſing of God in Prayer; for if you do not grant this, there is nothing in what you ſay, for as one man ought ſo to praiſe God when in a joyful frame, ſo you know ought a whole Church together to do the ſame. Pray conſider of this, it looks ill upon you.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:179241:29"/>
            <p n="2">2. We do not urge this Text to prove a whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ought to ſing together, and you know it well enough; but to prove that ſinging is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act, Duty, or Thing than that of praiſing of God you plead for, and would have to be Goſpel-ſinging: But however, we would willingly know, or be informed, if one Man when glad, or ſees cauſe to rejoyce in the Lord, may and ought to ſing, why many, if in the ſame frame, may not ſing, and ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p n="3">3. However, you are ſhort in this Duty, when merry, or ſee cauſe to rejoyce in the Lord as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon; do you ever ſing Pſalms? we hope you ſometimes are merry in the Lord, certainly you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude this intends ſome ſpecial Gift: Had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that was merry or joyful in the Lord, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Gift to ſing? or can you think the Apoſtle puts them upon a Duty they were not in a capacity to perform? 'Tis not left at the liberty of a perſon that is in a joyful frame to ſing Pſalms if he pleaſes, but he is as much required to ſing Pſalms as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon afflicted is to pray.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to <hi>Rhime, Tunes,</hi> &amp;c. if there be a ſinging of Pſalms (a proper ſinging we mean) without Tunes, Metre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may ſo ſing, thô we know none. Rhime we do not ſay is eſſential to ſinging, thô Verſe or Metre is, but blame us not we ſo ſing, ſeeing you poſitively affirm it is not unlawful. Talk no more of compoſed Pſalms, you know <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were compoſed by the Spirit of God, and Scripture ſongs are as Sacred as Scripture proſe; we know no Pſalms but thoſe called <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>You ſay this Singing here directed unto, is when a perſon is merry, or comfortable, which certainly is to be ſuitable to his praying when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and ſorrowful, which is not by reading a prayer of anothers compoſing, but by pouring out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179241:29"/>his Soul in earneſt Requeſts to God, as he ſhall be aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit. In like manner, the Singing here intended is not the reading and tuning of a Pſalm out of a Book, or writing of anothers compoſing; but his ſolemn expreſſing the praiſe of God, and his joyful thanks to God, as the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth aſſiſt him with a tuneable Voice, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: ſhall Prayer be with the Spirit, and ſinging praiſes, which is the higheſt worſhip be by a form?

            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Reply.</hi> That a perſon ſhould ſing when in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame, by influence or help of the Spirit, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, as a perſon afflicted is ſo to pray, and not by reading of a prayer; yet ſinging of Pſalms is one thing, and prayer another; may not a Man ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſing one of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, or other Scripture-Hymns, or Sacred Songs, becauſe he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it himſelf?

Now if every Man has not the ſpecial Gift to bring forth a Pſalm, both Matter, Manner and Tune, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by an immediate help of the Spirit, we find you ſuppoſe they cannot ſing Pſalms according to this Precept; nor muſt they ſing any Pſalms but of their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting: Doubtleſs the weakeſt perſon that had no ſpecial Gift, <hi>If merry in the Lord,</hi> is bound and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſing Pſalms as well as any other, therefore ſinging was not tyed up to perſons who had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gift ſo to ſing: Beſides, the Pſalms are contained in the Holy Scripture which we are to ſing, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being already compoſed by the Spirit; therefore praying and ſinging greatly differ, thô both are to be performed by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is a Book of Pſalms left for us in Gods Word to ſing by, but no Book of Prayers is there left for us to pray by, therefore you ſay nothing: Nor is that doubtleſs true which you conceive from <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. i.e. that the Apoſtle there gives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about ſinging, but rather 'tis about ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould not in our common diſcourſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſe fooliſh talking nor jeſting, but that God ſhould be always in our Minds, and we ready always to give thanks to him: For as Men are ſubject to ſing fooliſh Songs when merry, which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> implicitely reproves and gives directions then to ſing Pſalms: ſo they are as ready to uſe jeſtings and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh talkings, eſpeclally at Feaſts, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.

            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> If you have that which was chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſinging, what need is there to expect any more of the Spirit to be performed to endite a Pſalm, or to pray for ſuch pourings forth of the Spirit to that end? thô we all have cauſe to pray for more of the Holy Spirit to be poured forth, yet not to revive the practice of any Goſpel Ordinance, which we ſee plainly the Churches were enjoyned to perform; for if we want it to revive one Duty, we want it to revive all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Prayer is an Ordinance, Preaching is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and you are found in the diſcharge of all theſe Duties too, thô it may be in ſome things you may not ſo exactly be found in the performance of them according to the primitive Pattern, and may pray for the Spirit to be poured forth in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to help you to diſcharge your Duties in thoſe Ordinances; but you will not however neglect them under ſuch pretences, why then do you wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this of Singing the praiſes of God under ſuch a pretence, <hi>i. e.</hi> for want of more of the Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and utter a Pſalm?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What ground have you to expect, or to pray for thoſe extraordinary Gifts to perform any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Ordinance which were in the primitive Times? if there is no promiſe for their return, then no ground of Faith to pray for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. May not this tend to cauſe our people to caſt off all other Ordinances upon the ſame preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and turn Seekers? 'tis very dangerous what you ſuggeſt here.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It appears you allow of enditing a Pſalm, and that the Spirit may return to enable a perſon ſo to do. Brother, dare you ſay thoſe Godly Men who endite Hymns and Spiritual Songs do not bring them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179241:31"/>forth now by the help of the Holy Spirit? pray in form us, how we or any people may infallibly know that an Hymn is endited by the Spirit; may not, ſome as much queſtion whether you or other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters endite or compile their Sermons by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Spirit, by the ſame rule as you may queſtion whether or no they have the aſſiſtance of the Spirit to endite Hymns.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There are ſome that can, and do ſometimes now bring forth an Hymn extemporarily, may not you conclude the Spirit is returned already to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them ſo to do? or what evidence further do you expect of ſuch a thing hereafter, when more of the Spirit is poured forth? or how will you know, it is not a common nor a natural Gift which ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath? Brother, you ſeem to many wiſe men who have read your Epiſtle, to be in this matter a great <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Can any Man endite an Hymn or Pſalm without ſtudy and premediation? Certainly what you hint here of enditing and uttering a Pſalm or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Song when the Spirit is poured forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is juſt the ſame thing which we ſay many of the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by the preſent help of the Spirit are enabled to do now.</p>
